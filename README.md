# WTFIndexer-Android

WTFIndexer-Android is an Android app that I developed in Kotlin as a companion app to my app WTFIndexer. 

This app supports all of the same features that the web app does but was developed as a native Android App for easy access.

### Usage

When you run the app for the first time, you will see a pop up message telling you to enter the URL of your WTF Indexer instance. You can find this in the settings by tapping on the 3 dot menu at the top right.

You can find a precompiled apk in the release section.

Please contact me if you have any questions, run into any problems or would like to suggest new features.
