<h1 id="wtfindexer-android">WTFIndexer-Android</h1>
<p>WTFIndexer-Android is an Android app that I developed in Kotlin as a companion app to my app WTFIndexer. </p>
<p>This app supports all of the same features that the web app does but was developed as a native Android App for easy access.</p>
<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>When you run the app for the first time, you will see a pop up message telling you to enter the URL of your WTF Indexer instance. You can find this in the settings by tapping on the 3 dot menu at the top right.</p>
<p>Please contact me if you have any questons, run into any problems or would like to suggest new features. </p>
